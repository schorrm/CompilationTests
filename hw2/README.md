# Tests for HW 2

This folder has the tests for HW 2 (plus the other stuff they gave). I switched to a GitHub repo so updates will be easier, just run `git pull`, no need to move a zip around.

Run `python3.6 tests.py` or `python3 tests.py` to run the test package (you'll need to have the files here).

## Description

- t1 and t2 are theirs.
- t3 exists to check associativity and ordering with the basic arithmetic ops
- t4 tests associativity and order with logic mixed in
- t5 tests relops
- t6 is the same test but there's a nonassociative syntax error hidden in there.
- t7 runs an if-else-while stress test.

If you want to work here, the .gitignore is set to ignore your specific files to keep the branch clean.

Good luck!
